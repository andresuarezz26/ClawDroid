## Implement X (Twitter quick actions)

Currently the quick actions for the app are limited, so the app is trying a lot to finish the 
task using mobile automation. But, sometimes we have deelinks to navigate to single screens
of the app. 
This is an example to post a tweet on X: https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=YOUR_TEXT
This is most efficient as we expend less tokens, avoid on trusting in the mobile automations
capabilities of the agent.
